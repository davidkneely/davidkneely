🔭 I’m currently working on:

Team Number Dash is a fast, classroom-friendly multiplayer math game I designed to turn number practice into a shared challenge. Built with React and TypeScript, it lets small teams race against the clock to build equations, hit target numbers, and solve problems together, making math feel energetic, social, and fun. The game emphasizes quick thinking, communication, and confidence, with short sessions and clear visual feedback that fit naturally into real classrooms. It began as a collaborative learning prototype and has already sparked interest from educators looking for playful, team-based ways to strengthen number sense.
